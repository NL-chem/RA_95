# RA_95
Designing the retro-aldolase RA95.5-8F using Rosetta

In this project I want to model the binding mode for two new substrates and identify potentially beneficial mutations for the artfical retro-aldolase RA95.5-8F using Rosetta.

Rosetta_scripts: various rosetta script files I use for the project.
Data_analysis: shell scripts I use for analising the rosetta output files.
Submission: shell scripts I use to submit the rosetta jobs to the subercomputer.
Structure_processing: python scripts used for pdb file modifications or constraints file generation that are run within pymol.
