# RA_95
Designing the retro-aldolase RA95.5-8F using Rosetta

In this project I want to model the binding mode for two new substrates and identify potentially beneficial mutations for the artfical retro-aldolase RA95.5-8F using Rosetta.

The folder Rosetta_scripts contains the various rosetta script files I use for the project.
The folder Data_analysis contains the shell scripts I use for analising the rosetta output files.
The folder Submission contains the shell scripts I use to submit the rosetta jobs to the subercomputer.
The folder Structure_processing contains python scripts used for pdb file modifications or constraints file generation that are run in pymol.
